## My process

### Built with

- CSS Custom Properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Semantic HTML
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I learned more about creating HTML elements with JS and adding them to the DOM.

I also learned about dragging and dropping elements with JS, thanks to Web Deb Simplified on YouTube. I coded along with the video, trying to understand what was happening during each section.

### Continued development

The reduce method I want to understand better. I know how it works, but in the drag and drop function it gets quite complicated, using an object as the base value.

### Useful resources

- [Youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfYWwQrtzzY) - This is where the code comes from to make the drag and drop feature. All the credits go to Web Dev Simplified. In the video two containers are used, in the todo app there's only one container, so the code differs just a bit.

A big thank you to Web Dev Simplified for making videos on web development. The drag and drop functionality is his code. The video linked above made me understand how it works.
